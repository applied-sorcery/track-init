# track-init
I'm using React Native to make a minimalist initiative-tracking app for D&D or similar TTRPGs. The awesome thing about this app is that it connects to the [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) so DM's can quickly access open-source 5th edition D&D content. 

So using this app you could, for example, add 5 goblins to a battle, import your players/heros (feature coming soon), and the app will auto-roll initiative and keep track of whose turn it is-- all with just a few taps!

The coolest, latest feature is that I added Redux to the app to manage the state! Now, when you build a list of creatures by searching the API for creatures to add, your list shows up in the Combat View!
